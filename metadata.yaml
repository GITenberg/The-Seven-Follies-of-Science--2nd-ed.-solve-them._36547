tableOfContents: 'Preface -- The seven follies of science: Introductory note. Squaring
  the circle. The duplication of the cube. The trisection of an angle. Perpetual motion.
  The transmutation of metals, alchemy. The fixation of mercury. The universal medicine
  and the elixir of life -- Additional follies: Perpetual or ever-burning lamps. The
  alkahest or universal solvent. Palingenesy. The powder of sympathy -- A small budget
  of paradoxes, illusions, and marvels (with apologies to Professor De Morgan): The
  fourth dimension. How a space may be apparently enlarged by merely changing its
  shape. Can a man lift himself by the straps of his boots? How a spider lifted a
  snake. How the shadow may be made to move backward on the sun-dial. How a watch
  may be used as a compass. Micrography or minute writing; writing so fine that the
  whole Bible, if written in characters of the same size, might be inscribed twenty-two
  times on a square inch. Illusions of the senses (taste and smell; sense of heat;
  sense of hearing; sense of touch, one thing appearing as two). How objects may be
  apparently seen through a hole in the hand. How to see (apparently) through a solid
  brick -- Curious arithmetical problems: The chess-board problem. The nail problem.
  A question of population. How to become a millionaire. The actual cost and present
  value of the First Folio Shakespeare. Arithmetical puzzles. Archimedes and his fulcrum.'
